# CSVReader
A simple csv reader in Java that converts csv input to custom csv output. In this example, data from another company can be converted to standards that can be imported in AFAS business software.

# Running the reader
- Clone the project
- Cd to /out/artificats/CSVReader_jar
- Run 'java -jar CSVReader.java' 

(You might want to use a Linux shell script in order to run the reader. The script can be found in the project root.)
